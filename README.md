# Big Step Normalisation for the Untyped Crochet Calculus

This tool implements a (very) simple algorithm for converting .OFF 3d files into a sequence of crochet instructions in Haskell.
I found that the best way to do this was to implement a little crochet DSL and normalise the terms from my dumb algorithm.
This produces pretty reasonable crochet instructions!

However don't expect the end result to look exactly like what you started with - that might need some more careful implementation.
